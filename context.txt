**2. Detailed Description:**

The project proposes an architectural approach to PEM electrolyzer anode design, moving beyond conventional composition-based strategies. It introduces a digitally guided design-to-fabrication loop enabled by computational modeling and machine learning.

**Workflow:**

* **Digital Twin Generation**: Start with stochastic methods to recreate 3D microstructures representative of real catalyst layers.
* **Performance Prediction**: Use COMSOL-based simulations to analyze electrochemical and transport behavior of these structures.
* **AI-Driven Optimization**: Apply algorithms to modify microstructures, assess performance, and evolve towards optimal designs.
* **Fabrication**: Translate optimized structures to reality using 3D printing of titanium supports.
* **Deposition**: Coat supports with thin Ir layers through electrochemical methods.

This closed-loop framework ensures rapid development of functional catalyst layers with reduced Ir content, improved utilization, and enhanced durability.
